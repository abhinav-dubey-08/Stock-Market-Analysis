# Stock Market Analysis

This project is an **advanced stock market analysis and prediction model** designed to analyze historical stock market data and forecast future stock prices. The model demonstrates high accuracy and robustness, making it a valuable tool for investors and analysts to gain data-driven insights into market trends.

### Features:
- **Historical Data Analysis:** Provides a detailed examination of past stock market trends using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques.
- **Stock Price Prediction:** Utilizes **Random Forest Regression** to forecast future stock prices with reliable accuracy.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualizes trends and predictions to make insights clear and actionable.

### Tech Stack:
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** 
  - `pandas` (data manipulation)  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (data visualization)  
  - `scikit-learn` (machine learning)  

### How It Works:
1. **Data Collection:** Historical stock market data is imported and preprocessed.  
2. **EDA:** Data is analyzed to identify trends, correlations, and patterns.  
3. **Model Training:** 
   - A **Random Forest Regression** model is trained on the historical data to learn market patterns.
4. **Prediction:** The model forecasts future stock prices based on the learned patterns.  
5. **Visualization:** 
   - Predictions and historical data are visualized to provide clear insights into trends.
